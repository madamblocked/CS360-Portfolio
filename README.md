# CS360-Portfolio

Overall I think this app is a good start to a mobile application. The user needs to be able to access the application and record their initial weight. After that, the user needs to be able to create a log of weights and track that historically. The coding process itself is not too different than how I approach my job. Usually I try to establish the concepts that I want to develop outside of a codebase initially. I could use pen and paper or just write down notes and go from there. Then I will look at that for awhile and conceptually think about what code is required to write the program. Then I code. Then I test. And I test some more. Eventually I get past errors and run a real test, which shows me I have more errors and I spend more time fixing up those new errors and test yet again. Eventually we actually compile and feel successful. The developing was fun even though I don't see myself pursuing mobile applications in my career.
